<h1>My favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>John Wick 1-4</h3>
<p>John Wick is action packed and Keanu Reeves at his best. It`s also pretty rare  when the sequels are as good as the first one.</p>
<h3>Dune </h3>
<p>At first I wasn`t convinced but after watching it a second time I noticed the benefits of the slow pace and the minimalistic narrative to get the story going.</p>
<h3>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</h3>
<p>Nothing beats a good Western.</p>
